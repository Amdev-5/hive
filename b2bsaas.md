# B2B AI SaaS Strategy: February 2026 Launch Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on your background (AI Engineer + Amazon L4 SDE + Hive contributor) and market timing, here's your path to $10k MRR by end of February 2026.

---

## 1. WHAT TO BUILD

### Primary Product: **AI SDR Agent Suite**

The AI SDR market is growing at **29.5% CAGR** to [$15B by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-sdr-market-83561460.html). This is your sweet spot because:

- Hive already has **HubSpot integration** ready
- Salesforce integration is on the roadmap (you can accelerate this)
- The platform's **triangulated verification** solves the #1 AI SDR problem: unreliable outputs
- **Self-improving agents** = your product gets better automatically (major differentiator)

### Build These 3 Agents (In Order)

| Agent | What It Does | Pricing Potential |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Lead Enrichment Agent** | Web search → company research → HubSpot/CRM population → lead scoring | $500-1000/mo |
| **Outbound Sequencer Agent** | Personalized email generation → send via Resend → follow-up sequences → response handling | $1000-2000/mo |
| **Deal Intelligence Agent** | Monitor CRM deals → surface insights → alert on stalled deals → recommend actions | $500-1500/mo |

### Why This Stack Works

- Each agent delivers measurable ROI (leads found, emails sent, deals closed)
- Uses existing Hive tools (HubSpot, web search, email)
- Human-in-the-loop built-in = enterprise-ready compliance
- You can demo value in < 15 minutes

---

## 2. WHO TO TARGET (First 30 Days)

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

| Attribute | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| **Company Size** | 10-100 employees (Series A/B startups) |
| **Industry** | B2B SaaS, Tech Services, Agencies |
| **Role** | VP Sales, Head of Growth, RevOps, Founders |
| **Pain Point** | SDR team costs $60-80k/year per person, scaling is expensive |
| **Signal** | Recently raised funding, hiring SDRs, using HubSpot/Salesforce |

### Why This ICP?

- They have budget (just raised)
- They understand the problem (SDR hiring is painful)
- They're tech-forward (will adopt AI)
- Decision cycle is fast (< 30 days)

### Where to Find Them

| Source | How to Use |
|--------|-----------|
| **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** | Filter: Funding in last 6 months + SDR/Sales hiring + 10-100 employees |
| **Crunchbase** | Series A/B companies, last 90 days |
| **Apollo.io** | Build prospect lists with verified emails |
| **HubSpot Partner Directory** | Companies already using HubSpot = perfect fit |

---

## 3. HOW TO REACH THEM

### LinkedIn Outreach (Primary Channel)

Based on [2025 B2B lead gen data](https://www.growthmak.com/blog/the-2025-guide-to-generating-high-quality-b2b-leads-on-linkedin), 4 out of 5 B2B leads from social media come from LinkedIn.

### Your LinkedIn Profile Setup

```
Headline: "AI Sales Agents that Book Meetings | Ex-Amazon SDE | Helping B2B teams 10x pipeline without hiring SDRs"

About: [Problem] → [Solution] → [Proof] → [CTA]
```

### Outreach Sequence (The Velvet Rope Method)

**Day 1:** Connect (no pitch)
```
"Hey [Name], saw you're scaling the sales team at [Company].
Been building AI agents for exactly this problem. Would love to connect."
```

**Day 3:** Value-first message
```
"[Name], noticed [Company] is using HubSpot and hiring SDRs.

Quick question: what % of your SDRs' time goes to research vs. actual outreach?

Built an AI agent that handles the research + personalization automatically.
Happy to show you a 10-min demo if useful - no pitch, just showing what's possible."
```

**Day 7:** Follow-up with social proof
```
"One more thing - just helped a Series A SaaS team generate 47 qualified leads
in their first week using the agent. Sharing a quick Loom if you want to see how."
```

### Volume Targets

| Week | Connections Sent | Demos Booked | Close Rate |
|------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | 100 | 5-8 | 20% |
| 2 | 100 | 5-8 | 25% |
| 3 | 100 | 8-10 | 30% |
| 4 | 100 | 8-10 | 30% |

**Expected February outcome:** 6-10 paying customers

---

## 4. WHAT TO SELL & PRICING

### Pricing Strategy

Based on [2026 SaaS pricing trends](https://www.getmonetizely.com/blogs/the-2026-guide-to-saas-ai-and-agentic-pricing-models), use **hybrid pricing**:

### Starter Plan: $997/month
- 1 AI SDR Agent (Lead Enrichment OR Outbound)
- 500 leads/month processing
- HubSpot integration
- Email support
- *Target: 10 customers = $9,970 MRR*

### Growth Plan: $1,997/month
- Full AI SDR Suite (all 3 agents)
- 2,000 leads/month
- Priority support + Slack channel
- Custom workflow tweaks
- *Target: 3-5 customers = $6-10k MRR*

### Enterprise: $3,997+/month
- Unlimited processing
- Salesforce + custom CRM
- Dedicated success manager
- Custom agent development

### Why This Pricing Works

- ROI is clear: 1 human SDR = $5-7k/month fully loaded
- Your tool replaces 80% of that work at 15-20% of cost
- Outcome-based: customers pay for leads processed, not seats

## 5. MARKETING ASSETS

### Must-Have by Feb 1

| Asset | Purpose | Time to Build |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Landing Page** | Capture leads, explain value | 1-2 days |
| **Demo Video (Loom)** | Show the agent in action | 2 hours |
| **Case Study** | Social proof (use your own results first) | 1 day |
| **LinkedIn Content** | Build authority | Ongoing |

### Landing Page Structure

```
[Hero]
"AI Sales Agents That Book Meetings While You Sleep"
Subhead: "Stop paying $70k/year per SDR. Deploy AI that researches,
personalizes, and follows up - automatically."
CTA: "See 10-Min Demo"

[Problem]
- SDRs spend 60% of time on research, not selling
- Hiring is slow and expensive
- Generic outreach = low reply rates

[Solution]
- AI Lead Enrichment: Research 100 prospects in 10 minutes
- AI Outbound: Hyper-personalized emails at scale
- AI Deal Intel: Never miss a follow-up again

[How It Works]
1. Connect your CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce)
2. Define your ICP
3. Agent researches, writes, sends
4. You focus on closing

[Social Proof]
- "47 qualified leads in first week" - [Customer]
- Built on enterprise-grade AI (Anthropic Claude)
- Human-in-the-loop for quality control

[Pricing]
Starter: $997/mo | Growth: $1,997/mo | Enterprise: Custom

[CTA]
"Book a 15-Minute Demo"
```

### Tools to Build It Fast

| Tool | Cost | Use |
|------|------|-----|
| **Framer** or **Webflow** | $20-30/mo | Landing page |
| **Cal.com** | Free | Booking demos |
| **Loom** | Free | Demo videos |
| **Resend** (already in Hive) | Pay-as-go | Transactional email |
| **HubSpot Free CRM** | Free | Your own pipeline |
